		<h1>Types</h1>
		<p>There are over 70 different breeds of cats, but we are going to focus on the top 3.</p>
		<br/>
		<div id="types">
			<p>Persian: The persian is the most popular breed in the US. This is a long haired cat that is very affectionate and loyal. 
			They are characterized by a round face and short muzzle.</p> <br/>
			<img src="images/persian.jpg" alt="White Persian Cat">
			<p>Maine Coon: The maine coon is a larger size house cat that is known to be very gentle and loving. Hence the nickname 
			"The Gentle Giant". They have been known to average from 15 to 25 pounds. Their size makes them take longer to mature, 3 years
			vs the average one year for most cats.
			</p><br/> 
			<p>Exotic: The exotic is a lot like the persian, with the main exception that it has short hair. This signifigantly cuts
			down on the amount of grooming needed</p><br/>
